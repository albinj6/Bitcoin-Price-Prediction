## Data Collection
- Collect historical Bitcoin price data from reliable sources such as cryptocurrency exchanges and financial data providers.
- Gather additional features such as market sentiment, trading volumes, macroeconomic data, and event-based data.

## Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalize and scale the data to ensure uniformity.
- Perform feature engineering to create new features from existing data that enhance model input quality.

## Model Selection
- Used Linear Regression mode for prediction.

## Training Process
- Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the model using historical data and validate it with appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

## Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics.
- Use cross-validation techniques to validate the model on different subsets of the data.
- Fine-tune the model based on evaluation results and feedback.

## Deployment
- Develop a user-friendly interface or application for real-time price predictions.
- Deploy the solution on a scalable platform, ensuring efficient data processing and fast response times.
- Implement continuous monitoring and retraining mechanisms to maintain prediction accuracy over time.

## Future Scope
1. **Integration of Advanced Data Sources:** Incorporate alternative data sources such as blockchain analytics and social media sentiment for deeper insights.
2. **Development of Hybrid Models:** Combine traditional statistical models with machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance predictive capabilities.
3. **Real-Time and High-Frequency Trading Applications:** Enhance the model to handle real-time data streams and high-frequency trading scenarios.
